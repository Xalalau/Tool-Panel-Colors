- Better explain this odd/even (darker/lighter) thing in the legends
- Add proper markers on the selected panels
- Add rendering support for the color mixers textboxes
- Add proper multiplayer support:
	-- Apply the current colors on all players (server/admin)
	-- Use custom client colors over the server selection (client)
- Choose a default new color (so new players will know that the addon is working)
