1) Add nice indicators (with text and color) to the type selector
2) Add a customized menu preview
3) Add proper multiplayer support:
	-- Apply the current colors on all players (server/admin)
	-- Use custom client colors over the server selection (client)
4) Choose a default new color (so players will know that the addon is working)
